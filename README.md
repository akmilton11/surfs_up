### Overview of the statistical analysis:
W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in      order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results:
  * The mean temperature for both June and December were relateievly close. With June at 74.9 and December at 71.0
  * December has the lowest temperature between the two data sets. Recording a minimum of 56 degrees.
  * December had a higher std compared to June. December recorded a std of 3.75 while June recorded a std of 3.26

### Summary:
Ice cream is always great! W. Avy wanted to look at June and December to see if his business is sustainable year-round. When looking at the results of the two months, I would say it is sustainable year-round. Unless there are larger variances in other months, I would suspect W. Avy to have no issues running his business year-round.
  * Looking at two months of data six months apart is great - but pulling in more months to look at MoM data would benefit greatly. I think layering additional months would help create a better data summary
  * Adding precipiation to the analysis could help W. Avy determine his sustainability. If there is a rainy season, maybe W. Avy could help outline his business plan better in the future.
